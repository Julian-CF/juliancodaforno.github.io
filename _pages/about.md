I am a second year [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/) PhD student currently in the [Computational Principles of Intelligence Lab](http://cpilab.org/) in Munich. I am supervised by both [Eric Schulz](https://cpilab.org/eric.html) (LMU & Hehlmholtz AI) and [Jane X. Wang](http://www.janexwang.com/) (Google DeepMind).

Broadly, I am interested in building computational models of human behavior to 1) better understand human cognition and 2) try to leverage these insights in Machine Learning. So far in my PhD, I have been exploring how Large Language Models behave to later see how they can be used to inject human-like priors into RL agents.

When not doing research, I enjoy football, bouldering, skiing, calisthenics and dancing.
